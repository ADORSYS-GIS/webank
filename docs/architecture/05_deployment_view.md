# Deployment Overview
## 1. Deployment Scheme: Containerized Environment
The online banking application is deployed in a containerized environment rather than traditional bare metal or virtual machine setups. This approach offers several advantages for development, deployment, and operational efficiency:

### Benefits of Containerization

1.Consistent Environments: Containers ensure uniformity across development, testing, and production environments, reducing environment-specific bugs and simplifying troubleshooting.

2.Mature Orchestration: With orchestration technologies like **Kubernetes**, container deployment and management become more efficient, supporting automatic scaling, load balancing, and failover management.

3.Advanced Monitoring: The container ecosystem is supported by a wide range of monitoring and management tools, including Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack, to ensure continuous performance and health tracking.

## 2. Common Layout Across All Environments
Each environment follows a consistent layout to ensure uniformity, ease of management, and high availability.

## 3. Staging Concept
The staging concept is designed to ensure that development, testing, and deployment are handled efficiently and securely. Different environments serve specific purposes throughout the application lifecycle.

### a. Local Development Environment
**Purpose**: Focused on individual developer workflows, this environment allows developers to work independently without requiring internet access or shared resources.

**Key Characteristics**:

**_** Self-contained, operational without internet access.
**_** Ideal for coding, unit testing, and debugging.
**_** Uses the **Ledgers** reference banking system for development.

**Exceptions**: No CDN, monitoring, or backup system in this environment.
**Setup:** Configured using a docker-compose file.

## 4. Key Components in the Deployment

### a. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
**Purpose**: Delivers application code across various geographic regions to ensure fast, secure, and reliable access for users.
**Key Features:** Reduces latency, improves load times, and protects against DDoS attacks by distributing content.

### b. Online Banking Service
**Purpose**: Handles the core application logic, user request processing, session management, and secure transaction handling.
**Redundancy:** Redundant nodes ensure high availability and fault tolerance, with seamless failover in case of node failure.

### c. Core Banking System
**Purpose**: Manages financial operations such as transactions and account handling.
**Scalability:** Depending on the environmentâ€™s requirements, one or more nodes are deployed to ensure the system can handle necessary transaction volumes.

### d. Monitoring and Log Management
**Tools**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack collect, analyze, and visualize logs and metrics.
**Purpose:** Provides real-time monitoring of application performance, system health, and security events. Centralized log management helps with auditing and troubleshooting.

### e. Load Balancers
**Purpose**: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple nodes to prevent overload and improve performance. Helps enhance user experience by reducing response times.

### f. Backup and Recovery Systems
**Purpose**: Ensures regular backups for disaster recovery, securely backing up user information, transaction logs, and system configurations. These systems provide fast restoration in case of data loss or corruption.

### g. API Gateway
**Purpose**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, ensuring centralized security, traffic management, and access control. Handles SSL termination, load balancing, and logging for auditing purposes.
