# Quality Requirements

The quality requirements for this online banking application are designed to ensure that it meets high standards of performance, reliability, and usability. These requirements are critical to providing a seamless and satisfying user experience, as well as maintaining the trust and confidence of both users and financial institutions.

## Performance

### Target Response Time
The application is optimized to achieve a target response time of less than 200 milliseconds (ms) for API calls. This rapid response ensures that users experience minimal delays when interacting with the system, leading to a smooth and responsive experience. Achieving this target requires efficient API design, optimized data handling, and the use of caching strategies to minimize latency.

### High Throughput for Concurrent Transactions
The system is designed to handle high volumes of concurrent transactions without compromising performance. High throughput is essential for supporting the needs of financial institutions that may process thousands of transactions per second, especially during peak times. The architecture employs load balancing, horizontal scaling, and asynchronous processing to ensure that the system can manage a large number of simultaneous requests efficiently and reliably.

## Reliability

### 99.9% Uptime SLA
The application is committed to delivering a 99.9% uptime SLA, ensuring that the system is available and operational for the vast majority of the time. This high level of reliability is crucial for financial services, where downtime can lead to significant disruptions and loss of user trust. To achieve this SLA, the application incorporates robust infrastructure, including redundant systems, failover mechanisms, and real-time monitoring to quickly detect and resolve issues.

### Failover Mechanisms
Critical services within the application are supported by failover mechanisms that automatically redirect traffic to backup systems in the event of a failure. These mechanisms are designed to minimize downtime and ensure that users experience uninterrupted service even during unforeseen events. The failover strategy includes both active-active and active-passive configurations, depending on the specific requirements of each service.

## Usability

### Simple and Intuitive User Interface
The application features a user interface that is designed to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly. This design approach ensures that users can easily navigate the system and perform tasks with minimal effort. The interface is structured to reduce the learning curve, making it accessible to users of varying technical proficiency, including those who may not be familiar with digital banking.

### Support for Multiple Languages and Easy Localization
To accommodate a diverse user base, the application supports multiple languages and offers easy localization. Users can select their preferred language, ensuring that the interface is accessible and comprehensible to individuals from different linguistic backgrounds. The localization process is streamlined, allowing for the quick and efficient adaptation of the application to new markets or regions. This flexibility is crucial for expanding the application's reach and providing a consistent user experience across different cultures and geographies.
