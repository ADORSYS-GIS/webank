# Risks and Technical Debt

As with any complex software development project, the online banking application faces certain risks and potential technical debt that must be proactively managed. Identifying and mitigating these risks early in the process is crucial to ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of the application.

## Identified Risks

### Integration Challenges with Legacy Core Banking Systems
Online banking services rely on the ISO20022 data format to deliver services to apps. We assume that most CBS provide a reasonable mapping to the ISO20022 format. However, integrating modern applications with legacy core banking systems presents significant challenges, including compatibility issues, data format mismatches, and limitations of outdated technology. These challenges can lead to delays, increased development costs, and potential disruptions in service delivery.

### Data Privacy and Regulatory Compliance in Multiple Jurisdictions
The online banking application is developed to be used across multiple African countries, starting with Cooperative Financial Institutions (CFIs) in Eswatini. The application must comply with a diverse range of data privacy laws and regulations specific to each jurisdiction where it will operate. This includes local data protection laws in Eswatini and other African nations, as well as broader international standards. Navigating this complex regulatory landscape presents risks, including potential legal liabilities, fines, and reputational damage if compliance is not adequately maintained.

### Ensuring Consistent Performance Across a Wide Range of Mobile Devices
The online banking application is primarily built for mobile devices, catering to a target population where many users may own older Android phones or low-quality devices due to limited purchasing power. Ensuring that the application functions consistently across this diverse range of devices presents significant challenges. The application must remain performant on lower-end devices, which often have limited processing power, memory, and storage, without compromising the experience on more advanced hardware.

### Managing Bandwidth and Network Availability Risks
The application must operate effectively in environments with varying network conditions. Bandwidth limitations and inconsistent network availability are common issues in many regions, particularly in rural areas of Africa. These factors pose a risk to the application's performance, potentially leading to slow load times, interrupted sessions, and a degraded user experience.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Early Integration Testing with Pilot CFIs
To address integration challenges with legacy core banking systems, early integration testing will be conducted with a select group of pilot Cooperative Financial Institutions (CFIs). These pilot programs will allow the development team to identify and resolve integration issues before the application is rolled out more broadly. By working closely with these pilot CFIs, the team can gather valuable feedback, refine the integration process, and ensure a smoother deployment for other institutions.

### Regular Compliance Checks and Updates
Maintaining data privacy and regulatory compliance is a dynamic process that requires continuous monitoring and updating. The application will undergo regular compliance audits to ensure that it adheres to the latest regulations in all jurisdictions where it operates. Additionally, the legal and compliance teams will stay informed of any changes in regulations, enabling timely updates to the application’s data handling and storage practices.

### Performance Testing on Various Devices and Network Conditions
To ensure consistent performance across a wide range of devices, the application will be subjected to rigorous performance testing under different scenarios. This includes testing on devices with varying hardware specifications, operating systems, and network conditions. Performance optimization strategies, such as adaptive UI scaling, efficient resource management, and selective feature loading, will be implemented to ensure that the application delivers a smooth experience on all supported devices.

## Technical Debt Management

Effective management of technical debt is crucial to maintaining the long-term sustainability, scalability, and performance of the mobile banking application. By proactively identifying, tracking, and addressing technical debt, the development team ensures that the application remains robust, maintainable, and adaptable to future needs.

### Identification and Tracking of Technical Debt

#### Active Identification
The development team will continuously monitor the codebase to identify instances of technical debt. This includes recognizing areas where shortcuts were taken, code that may be fragile or difficult to maintain, and components that may not be fully optimized.

#### Documentation and Tracking
Once identified, technical debt will be meticulously documented and tracked throughout the project lifecycle. This documentation will include the nature of the debt, its potential impact on the system, and the estimated effort required for remediation. Tools such as issue trackers or project management software will be used to log and prioritize technical debt items alongside feature requests and bug reports.

#### Impact Assessment
Each instance of technical debt will be assessed for its impact on the system’s overall health and future development. This assessment will help prioritize which debt needs to be addressed sooner and which can be deferred, based on factors such as the potential for introducing bugs, hindering performance, or complicating future enhancements.

### Proactive Refactoring and Incremental Improvements

#### Regular Refactoring Sessions
The development process will include scheduled refactoring sessions where the codebase is revisited, cleaned up, and optimized. During these sessions, the team will focus on improving code quality, simplifying complex or convoluted logic, and enhancing the overall architecture of the application.

#### Incremental Improvements
Instead of allowing technical debt to pile up, the team will implement incremental improvements as part of the ongoing development process. By addressing small portions of technical debt in each development cycle, the team can gradually reduce the overall debt without disrupting the delivery of new features.

#### Code Reviews and Best Practices
Regular code reviews will be conducted to catch potential technical debt early. Adhering to coding best practices, such as writing modular, testable, and well-documented code, will help minimize the introduction of new technical debt.

### Resource Allocation for Technical Debt Remediation

#### Time and Personnel Allocation
Specific time and personnel will be allocated to technical debt remediation as an integral part of the development process. This allocation ensures that addressing technical debt is treated as a priority, rather than an afterthought.

#### Balancing Feature Development with Debt Management
The development roadmap will include a balance between new feature development and technical debt management. By integrating debt remediation into the regular development cycles, the team can ensure that the application remains maintainable and scalable over time.

#### Budget Considerations
Allocating a portion of the project budget to technical debt management ensures that the necessary resources are available to address debt without impacting other project priorities. This financial planning helps mitigate the risk of debt-related issues affecting the project’s timeline or quality.
