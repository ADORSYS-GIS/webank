# Monitoring Concept for Online Banking Application

---

## 1. Overview
The **monitoring concept** for the online banking application is designed to ensure real-time visibility into system performance, health, and security across all environments (development, staging, production). It includes the use of industry-standard tools for collecting metrics, managing logs, and setting up alerts for proactive issue detection.

The monitoring system will be built using the following key tools:
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and monitoring.
- **Grafana**: Visualizing metrics through real-time dashboards.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Centralized log management for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

---

## 2. Objectives
The primary objectives of this monitoring setup are:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track the health, performance, and availability of all components, including frontend, backend, and core banking system.
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from all parts of the system to a central location for easier troubleshooting and auditing.
- **Proactive Alerting**: Set up automated alerts for critical issues, such as high CPU usage, slow API response times, or failed transactions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitor key metrics to optimize performance and detect bottlenecks.

---

## 3. Key Metrics to Monitor
### a. Frontend
- **API Response Times**: Monitor the response times of API calls from the frontend to the backend.
- **Page Load Times**: Track the time it takes for the frontend to render the user interface.
- **Errors**: Monitor any client-side errors or failed API requests.

### b. Backend
- **CPU and Memory Usage**: Monitor the CPU and memory consumption of the Spring Boot services to ensure resource utilization is within optimal limits.
- **API Throughput and Latency**: Track the number of API requests handled, response times, and error rates.
- **Transaction Rates**: Track the number of transactions processed per minute, including failed transactions.

### c. Core Banking System
- **Transaction Volumes**: Monitor the volume of transactions processed by the core banking system.
- **System Uptime**: Ensure that the core banking system is up and running consistently.
- **Integration Failures**: Monitor any errors or timeouts when integrating with third-party banking services.

### d. Infrastructure
- **Server Health**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage on all nodes (CDN, API gateway, load balancers, backup servers).
- **Network Traffic**: Track the amount of network traffic flowing through load balancers and API gateways.

## 4. Tools and Setup

### a. Prometheus
- **Purpose**: Prometheus will be used to scrape metrics from the various components of the system, including the backend services, database, and infrastructure.
- **Integration**: Each service will expose an endpoint (`/metrics`) from which Prometheus can scrape performance data.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - API latency and throughput
  - System resource usage (CPU, memory)


### b. Grafana
- **Purpose**: Grafana will be used to visualize the data collected by Prometheus through custom dashboards.
- **Dashboards**: Create dashboards for different environments (development, staging, production) to provide real-time visibility into system performance.
- **Key Visualizations**:
  - CPU and memory usage over time
  - API request/response rates
  - Transaction volumes
  

### c. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Purpose**: ELK Stack will handle centralized logging, collecting logs from the backend services, API gateways, and load balancers.
- **Log Management**:
  - **Logstash** will aggregate and filter logs before sending them to Elasticsearch.
  - **Elasticsearch** will store the logs in a structured format, making them searchable.
  - **Kibana** will provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing and querying logs.
- **Key Logs**:
  - API errors and exceptions
  - Authentication and security events
  - Core banking system failures

## 5. Alerting System
### a. Prometheus Alertmanager
- **Purpose**: Alerts will be configured using **Prometheus Alertmanager** to notify the team when certain thresholds are exceeded or when critical system failures occur.
- **Alert Channels**: Notifications will be sent to relevant team members via email, Slack  for immediate action.
- **Critical Alerts**:
  - **High CPU Usage**: Triggered when CPU usage exceeds 85% for more than 5 minutes.
  - **Slow API Response**: Triggered when average API response times exceed 2 seconds.
  - **Transaction Failures**: Triggered when transaction failure rates exceed 1% in a 10-minute window.

### b. Custom Alerts in Grafana
- **Purpose**: Set up custom alerts in Grafana for visual notifications within the dashboards.
- **Types of Alerts**:
  - Service downtime for more than 2 minutes.
  - Disk space usage exceeding 90%.

---

## 6. Logging and Auditing
- **Centralized Logging**: All logs from the online banking application will be sent to **Logstash**, where they will be indexed in **Elasticsearch** and made available for querying in **Kibana**.
- **Log Retention**: Logs will be retained for some time in the development environment and  in staging and production environments for compliance and troubleshooting.
- **Auditing**: Logs will include detailed information on user activities, authentication attempts, and failed transactions to ensure compliance with audit requirements.

---

## 7. Real-Time Dashboards
### a. Key Dashboards in Grafana:
1. **API Performance Dashboard**: Displays API throughput, latency, and error rates.
2. **System Health Dashboard**: Shows CPU, memory, and disk usage across all environments.
3. **Security Events Dashboard**: Tracks login attempts, failed authentications, and potential security breaches.

---

## 8. Conclusion
The **monitoring concept** for the online banking application provides a comprehensive solution for tracking system performance, availability, and security. By leveraging **Prometheus** for metrics collection, **Grafana** for visualization, and **ELK Stack** for log management, the system will have full visibility into all environments, ensuring quick detection and resolution of issues, as well as providing insights for optimization and scaling.
