# Monitoring Concept for Online Banking Application

---

## 1. Overview
The **monitoring concept** for the online banking application aims to ensure real-time visibility into system performance, health, and security across all environments (development, staging, production). This setup includes the use of industry-standard tools for metrics collection, visualization, and alerting to proactively detect and resolve issues.

The monitoring system will be built using the following key tools:
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and monitoring.
- **Grafana**: Visualizing metrics through real-time dashboards.

---

## 2. Objectives
The primary objectives of this monitoring setup are:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track the health, performance, and availability of all components, including frontend, backend, and core banking system.
- **Proactive Alerting**: Set up automated alerts for critical issues, such as high CPU usage, slow API response times, or failed transactions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitor key metrics to optimize performance and detect bottlenecks.

---

## 3. Key Metrics to Monitor
### a. Frontend
- **API Response Times**: Monitor the response times of API calls from the frontend to the backend. Aim to keep the average response time under 200ms.
- **Page Load Times**: Track the time it takes for the frontend to render the user interface. Target a load time of less than 2 seconds.
- **Errors**: Monitor any client-side errors or failed API requests. Aim to keep the error rate below 1%.

### b. Backend
- **CPU and Memory Usage**: Monitor the CPU and memory consumption of the Spring Boot services. Target CPU usage under 70% and memory usage below 75% to ensure optimal performance.
- **API Throughput and Latency**: Track the number of API requests handled, response times, and error rates. Ensure API throughput is high and latency remains below 100ms.
- **Transaction Rates**: Track the number of transactions processed per minute, including failed transactions. Aim for transaction success rates above 99%.

### c. Core Banking System
- **Transaction Volumes**: Monitor the volume of transactions processed by the core banking system. Ensure transaction volumes are within expected ranges and scalable.
- **System Uptime**: Ensure that the core banking system is up and running consistently. Aim for 99.9% uptime.
- **Integration Failures**: Monitor any errors or timeouts when integrating with third-party banking services. Keep integration failure rates below 0.5%.

### d. Infrastructure
- **Server Health**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage on all nodes (CDN, API gateway, load balancers, backup servers). Target CPU usage below 70%, memory usage under 75%, and disk usage below 80%.
- **Network Traffic**: Track the amount of network traffic flowing through load balancers and API gateways. Monitor for unusual spikes or drops in traffic.

## 4. Tools and Setup

### a. Prometheus
- **Purpose**: Prometheus will be used to scrape metrics from the various components of the system, including the backend services, database, and infrastructure.
- **Integration**: Each service will expose an endpoint (`/metrics`) from which Prometheus can scrape performance data.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - API latency and throughput
  - System resource usage (CPU, memory)

### b. Grafana
- **Purpose**: Grafana will be used to visualize the data collected by Prometheus through custom dashboards.
- **Dashboards**: Create dashboards for different environments (development, staging, production) to provide real-time visibility into system performance.
- **Key Visualizations**:
  - CPU and memory usage over time
  - API request/response rates
  - Transaction volumes

---

## 5. Alerting System
### a. Prometheus Alertmanager
- **Purpose**: Alerts will be configured using **Prometheus Alertmanager** to notify the team when certain thresholds are exceeded or when critical system failures occur.
- **Alert Channels**: Notifications will be sent to relevant team members via email, Slack for immediate action.
- **Critical Alerts**:
  - **High CPU Usage**: Triggered when CPU usage exceeds 85% for more than 5 minutes.
  - **Slow API Response**: Triggered when average API response times exceed 2 seconds.
  - **Transaction Failures**: Triggered when transaction failure rates exceed 1% in a 10-minute window.

### b. Custom Alerts in Grafana
- **Purpose**: Set up custom alerts in Grafana for visual notifications within the dashboards.
- **Types of Alerts**:
  - Service downtime for more than 2 minutes.
  - Disk space usage exceeding 90%.

---

## 6. Real-Time Dashboards
### a. Key Dashboards in Grafana:
1. **API Performance Dashboard**: Displays API throughput, latency, and error rates.
2. **System Health Dashboard**: Shows CPU, memory, and disk usage across all environments.
3. **Security Events Dashboard**: Tracks login attempts, failed authentications, and potential security breaches.

---

## 7. Conclusion
The **monitoring concept** for the online banking application provides a comprehensive solution for tracking system performance, availability, and security. By leveraging **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Grafana** for visualization, the system will have full visibility into all environments, ensuring quick detection and resolution of issues, as well as providing insights for optimization and scaling.
