# Staging Concept for WEBANK

The staging concept for our online banking application is structured around a set of distinct environments, each tailored to a specific stage in the development and deployment lifecycle. These environments ensure that the application is developed, tested, and deployed in a controlled and secure manner, allowing for efficient management of the application throughout its lifecycle.

## 1. Local Development Environment

**Purpose:**  
This environment is used by developers to work independently on their machines. It allows them to develop and test features without relying on shared resources or internet access, thus promoting productivity even in offline scenarios.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Self-contained and runs entirely on the developer's local machine.
- Ideal for coding, unit testing, and debugging in isolation from other environments.
- Excludes production-level features such as CDN, monitoring, logging, and backups.

**Setup:**  
Typically set up using `docker-compose`, which replicates the application components locally, ensuring developers can test changes in an isolated environment.

## 2. Integration Test Environment

**Purpose:**  
This environment is designed to validate the integration of the various components within the application. Automated tests are run here to ensure that the system works as expected across different integrated core banking systems like Ledgers and Mambu.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Each core banking system is assigned a dedicated instance of this environment.
- Focuses on ensuring that different components and services interact correctly.
- Allows for isolated testing, reducing the risk of interference between systems.

**Setup:**  
Deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, providing a scalable and isolated platform for integration testing.

## 3. Quality Assurance (QA) Test Environment

**Purpose:**  
Used by business analysts and quality assurance teams to validate the business logic and functionality of the application. Each instance is customized to reflect the specific needs of different Cooperative Financial Institutions (CFIs), ensuring that the tests align with business requirements.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Dedicated to QA validation and business use case testing.
- Tailored to reflect the configuration and operational needs of each CFI.
- The last testing phase before deployment to the production environment.

**Setup:**  
Like the Integration Test Environment, it is hosted in a Kubernetes cluster, offering the necessary scalability and isolation for thorough QA testing.

## 4. Production Environment

**Purpose:**  
This environment hosts the live version of the application, accessed by end users. Each instance is specific to a CFI, ensuring the application meets operational and regulatory requirements. The production environment is the final deployment and must be highly secure and reliable.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Represents the live, user-facing application.
- Highly secure, with strong access control and monitoring.
- Includes redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
- Constantly monitored to detect and respond to performance or security issues.

**Setup:**  
Deployed in a highly secured Kubernetes cluster, incorporating monitoring and failover systems to ensure stability and security.

## 5. Bug-Fix Environment

**Purpose:**  
A temporary environment, created to replicate the production environment as closely as possible for debugging and fixing critical issues. This environment enables the development and support teams to reproduce issues, apply fixes, and validate them before deploying the changes to production.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Mirrors the production environment for accurate bug replication.
- Temporary and dismantled once the bug is resolved.
- Essential for testing and verifying bug fixes in an environment that mimics production.

**Setup:**  
Temporarily created in a Kubernetes cluster to replicate the production setup, providing isolation and ensuring bugs can be tested and resolved without impacting the live system.
