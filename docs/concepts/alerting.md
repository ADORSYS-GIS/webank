# Alerting Concept for Online Banking Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the alerting concept for the mobile banking application. The purpose of the alerting system is to enhance user engagement, provide timely notifications about important transactions, and ensure the security of user accounts.

---
## 2. Objectives

- Notify users about significant account activities.
- Provide customizable alert preferences to enhance user experience.
- Ensure timely communication of security-related events.
- Facilitate user awareness of account balances and payment schedules.
---
## 3. Types of Alerts

The alerting system will support the following types of alerts:

### 3.1 Transaction Alerts
- **Description**: Notifications for account transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Any transaction exceeding a predefined amount or any transaction made by the user.

### 3.2 Balance Alerts
- **Description**: Notifications when the account balance falls below a specified threshold.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Balance drops below the user-defined limit.

### 3.3 Security Alerts
- **Description**: Notifications for suspicious activities, such as unauthorized login attempts or transactions from unrecognized devices.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Login attempts from new devices or IP addresses, and abnormal transaction patterns.

### 3.4 Payment Reminders
- **Description**: Alerts for upcoming bill payments or due dates.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Payments due within a user-defined time frame (e.g., 3 days before due date).

### 3.5 Promotional Alerts
- **Description**: Information about new features, offers, or updates in the banking application.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Periodic promotional campaigns.

## 4. User Preferences

Users will have the ability to customize their alert preferences:

### 4.1 Notification Channels
- Users can select preferred channels for receiving alerts:
    - Push Notifications
    - SMS
    - Email

### 4.2 Frequency and Timing
- Users can choose how frequently they receive alerts (e.g., immediate, daily summaries).

### 4.3 Alert Types
- Users can enable or disable specific alert types according to their preferences.
---
## 5. Backend Implementation

### 5.1 Event Monitoring
- A real-time event monitoring system will be implemented to track user activities and transactions.

### 5.2 Trigger Conditions
- The system will evaluate predefined conditions to determine when to trigger alerts.

### 5.3 Alert Queue Management
- An alert queue will be maintained to manage and prioritize alert delivery efficiently.

### 5.4 Notification Service Integration
- The alerting system will integrate with a notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) for delivering alerts to users.
---
## 6.  Tools for Alerting

### 6.1 Prometheus
- **Description**: Prometheus will be used for monitoring and alerting the application and collecting metrics.
- **Usage**:
    - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the application.
    - Set up alert rules in Prometheus to trigger alerts based on predefined conditions (e.g., high error rates, performance metrics).

### 6.2 Grafana
- **Description**: Grafana will be used for visualizing metrics and setting up dashboards.
- **Usage**:
    - Connect Grafana to the Prometheus data source.
    - Create dashboards to visualize real-time data and alert statuses.
    - Set up alert notifications in Grafana to inform users or administrators based on metrics collected by Prometheus.
---
## 7. Frontend Implementation

### 7.1 Alert Dashboard
- A dedicated section in the app will display recent alerts for users.

### 7.2 Settings Page
- A user-friendly settings page will allow users to manage their alert preferences.
---
## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Two-Factor Authentication
- Implement 2FA for critical actions to enhance account security and alert notifications.

### 8.2 Sensitive Information
- Avoid including sensitive information in alert messages to mitigate phishing risks.
---
## 9. Testing and Feedback

### 9.1 User Testing
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the alerting features.

### 9.2 Continuous Improvement
- Use feedback to refine alert types, delivery methods, and user interfaces.
---
## 10. Example Workflow

### 10.1 Workflow Steps
1. **User Action**: A user initiates a transaction (e.g., withdrawal).
2. **Event Monitoring**: The backend detects the transaction.
3. **Condition Check**: The system checks if the transaction meets trigger conditions.
4. **Alert Generation**: An alert is created and queued for delivery.
5. **Notification Delivery**: The alert is sent to the user via their preferred channel.
6. **User Interface Update**: The alert appears in the userâ€™s alert dashboard.

## 11. Conclusion

The alerting concept for the online banking application is designed to enhance user engagement and security through timely notifications. By implementing customizable alert preferences and ensuring efficient alert management, the application aims to provide a seamless and secure banking experience for users.

By integrating Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization, the alerting system will be robust and provide valuable insights into application performance and user activity.
