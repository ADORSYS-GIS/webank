# Alerting Concept

## Introduction

This document outlines the technical alerting system implemented for our Online Banking Application. The system is designed to monitor and alert on the application's state, ensuring the health, performance, and reliability of our services.

## Technical Alerts Overview

Technical alerts are automated notifications triggered by predefined conditions or thresholds related to the application's state, performance, and infrastructure. These alerts are crucial for maintaining the stability and efficiency of our online banking platform.

Key aspects of our technical alerting system include:

1. **Application State Monitoring**: Alerts triggered by unexpected changes in the application's state, including data inconsistencies, session anomalies, and state transition errors.

2. **Performance Metrics**: Alerts based on key performance indicators such as response time, throughput, and error rates exceeding defined thresholds.

3. **Infrastructure Health**: Notifications for issues related to server resources, database performance, and network connectivity.

4. **Security Alerts**: Automated warnings for potential security breaches, unusual access patterns, or authentication anomalies.

5. **System Integration Alerts**: Notifications for failures or inconsistencies in integrations with external systems or APIs.

## Alert Categories

Our technical alerts are categorized into the following areas:

1. **Critical System Alerts**: Immediate action required; severe impact on core banking functions.
2. **Performance Degradation Alerts**: Warnings about declining system performance that may affect user experience.
3. **Data Integrity Alerts**: Notifications about potential data inconsistencies or corruption.
4. **Security Breach Alerts**: Immediate notifications for detected or suspected security incidents.
5. **Infrastructure Alerts**: Warnings about hardware, network, or cloud service issues.

## Alert Mechanisms

Alerts are delivered through:

- Automated emails to the technical team
- SMS messages for critical issues
- Integration with IT service management tools
- Dashboards for real-time monitoring

## Response and Escalation

Each category of alert has a defined response protocol, including:

1. Initial assessment procedures
2. Troubleshooting guidelines
3. Escalation pathways for unresolved issues
4. Post-incident review processes

## Continuous Improvement

Our technical alerting system undergoes regular review and optimization, including:

- Periodic threshold adjustments based on historical data
- Integration of new monitoring technologies
- Regular testing of alert mechanisms
- Feedback incorporation from incident post-mortems
