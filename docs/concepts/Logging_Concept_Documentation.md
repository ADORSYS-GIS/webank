# Logging Concept for Online Banking Middleware

## Overview

Logging is a crucial aspect of modern software systems, particularly in banking applications, where transaction tracking, error tracing, and system performance are vital. For an online banking middleware that connects remote end-users to Core Banking Systems (CBS) such as ours, logging is essential to maintain application reliability, security, and compliance.

This document outlines the logging framework, available technologies, and selected tools that will ensure efficient and secure logging for our system.

## Purpose of Logging

Logging will serve multiple purposes in our software system:

1. **Debugging**: Logs help track down and understand bugs in the code by providing a record of the application's behavior.
2. **Monitoring**: Logs offer visibility into system health and performance, which is crucial for detecting and fixing issues early.
3. **Auditing**: In a banking environment, logging is essential for compliance, recording user activities and system events for later analysis.
4. **Security**: Logs help detect suspicious activities and ensure that access to sensitive data and systems is recorded, which is important for both internal monitoring and regulatory compliance.

## Types of Logs

There are several types of logs that will be generated in this system:

- **Error Logs**: Capture information about issues that prevent the application from functioning correctly.
- **Warning Logs**: Indicate potential problems that could develop into critical issues.
- **Information Logs**: Record regular system operations like successful transactions or user login activities.
- **Debug Logs**: Provide detailed information about the internal state of the application, useful during development.
- **Audit Logs**: Capture all system activities relevant for regulatory compliance and security, such as financial transactions or access to sensitive data.

## Logging Levels

To classify logs and control the amount of information generated, we will follow these logging levels:

- **DEBUG**: Detailed information, mainly useful for developers during debugging.
- **INFO**: General operational events (e.g., user actions, state changes).
- **WARN**: Indicates a potential issue or situation that requires attention but is not immediately critical.
- **ERROR**: Captures errors that affect system operations, but the system remains functional.
- **FATAL**: Critical errors leading to system crashes or major disruptions.

## Logging Technologies

Here’s an overview of logging technologies and frameworks that are appropriate for the system, along with those selected for our implementation:

### 1. **Logging Frameworks for Application Code**
These frameworks are integrated into the application for generating structured logs:

- **SLF4J + Logback** (Selected):
  - **Description**: SLF4J is a simple facade for various logging frameworks, with Logback as its robust, asynchronous logging implementation. Ideal for Spring Boot applications.
  - **Why selected**: It integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, offering features like log rotation and performance-tuned asynchronous logging.

- **Log4j2**:
  - **Description**: A popular logging library with advanced configuration options.
  - **Why not selected**: SLF4J + Logback was chosen for better Spring Boot compatibility, though Log4j2 is still a viable alternative.

- **Serilog**:
  - **Description**: A structured logging framework for .NET.
  - **Why not selected**: Not relevant for our Java-based Spring Boot backend but suitable for .NET projects.

### 2. **Centralized Logging & Aggregation Tools**
Once logs are generated, they need to be stored, aggregated, and analyzed in a centralized system:

- **ELK Stack (Selected)**:
  - **Description**: A powerful open-source solution consisting of Elasticsearch (for log storage and searching), Logstash (for log ingestion and parsing), and Kibana (for visualization).
  - **Why selected**: We have prior experience with the ELK stack, and it’s known for handling large volumes of log data efficiently.

- **Graylog**:
  - **Description**: An open-source log management platform similar to ELK, with real-time log analysis features.
  - **Why not selected**: ELK Stack offers more advanced features and is better suited for our current infrastructure.

- **Splunk**:
  - **Description**: A commercial solution for log management, widely used in enterprise environments.
  - **Why not selected**: While powerful, its licensing costs make it less suitable for our current needs.

### 3. **Log Shipping Agents**
These tools help collect and forward logs from the application or server to a centralized logging system:

- **Filebeat (Selected)**:
  - **Description**: A lightweight log shipper for forwardin: AWS CloudWatch
  - CloudWatch will be used to monitor logs from the AWS-hosted infrastructure in real time, with alerts set up for critical log events.g and centralizing log data to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
  - **Why selected**: Easily integrates with the ELK stack, which we will use for our centralized logging.

- **Fluentd**:
  - **Description**: A data collector that works with various logging backends.
  - **Why not selected**: Filebeat is simpler and better integrated with our chosen ELK Stack.

### 4. **Cloud Logging Solutions**
**If** running in the cloud, these services provide managed logging capabilities (**None selected yet**):

- **AWS CloudWatch Logs**:
  - **Description**: A fully managed logging service for AWS infrastructure. It collects and monitors log data in real-time.

- **Azure Monitor**:
  - **Description**: A logging service for Azure-hosted applications.

- **Google Cloud Logging**:
  - **Description**: A managed logging solution for Google Cloud.

### 5. **Security and Audit Logging**
In a banking application, security and audit logs are essential to ensure regulatory compliance and monitor suspicious activities (**None selected yet**):

- **Auditd**:
  - **Description**: A Linux auditing framework that tracks security-relevant events, such as access to sensitive files or commands executed by privileged users.

- **OSSEC**:
  - **Description**: An open-source intrusion detection system with strong logging and monitoring capabilities.

## Proposed Logging Architecture

### 1. **Application-Level Logging**
- **Framework**: SLF4J with Logback (Spring Boot)
- **Log Format**: Logs will be generated in JSON format to allow easy parsing and analysis in ELK Stack.
- **Logging Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, as previously defined.

### 2. **Log Aggregation and Analysis**
- **Tool**: ELK Stack
  - **Log Shipping**: Logs will be shipped from the Spring Boot application using Filebeat.
  - **Search and Analysis**: Logs will be indexed in Elasticsearch and visualized using Kibana for real-time monitoring and alerting.

### 3. **Cloud-Based Logging and Monitoring**
- **To be decided**

### 4. **Security Logging**
- **To be decided**

## Further Considerations

- **Log Format**: Proposed structure for logs:
    - Timestamp
    - Log level
    - Component or module name
    - Context or correlation ID (to trace actions through the system)
    - Descriptive message
    - Optional metadata (e.g., user ID, request ID)

- **Log Rotation and Retention**: Define how long logs will be stored and how they'll be archived or deleted (log rotation) to avoid overwhelming storage systems while adhering to data retention policies, especially for financial applications.

- **Security and Compliance**:
Ensure logs don’t contain sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) unless necessary and properly encrypted.
Implement appropriate access controls for viewing and managing logs.
Consider regulatory requirements for auditing and traceability (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR).

- **Performance Impact**: Ensure that logging doesn't affect the performance of the application. This might involve adjusting the verbosity of logs in production (e.g., minimizing DEBUG logs) or using asynchronous logging techniques.

- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Integrate with monitoring systems to trigger alerts on specific log events (e.g., critical errors, unusual activity) so the team can respond quickly.
